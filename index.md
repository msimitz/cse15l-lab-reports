September 7, 10:00 AM
District Court
Courtroom No. 1
Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.
 
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
 
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)
 
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.
 
Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.
 
Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.
 
Edgeworth:
You may call your first witness.* The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!
 
Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.
 
Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!
 
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.
 
Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.
 
Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?
 
Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!
 
Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.
 
Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)
 
Floor plans added to the Court Record.
 
Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...
 
Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!
 
Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?
 
Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!
 
Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe, Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."
 
Witness Testimony
-- Maya Fey's Arrest --
Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
There were two people there already:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!
 
Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.
 
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)
 
...whoosh...
SMACK!
Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)
 
Judge:
Something the matter?
 
Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.
 
Phoenix:
(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)
 
Phoenix:
OBJECTION!
 
Phoenix:
Hold on just one second!
 
Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?
 
Phoenix:
If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?
 
Gumshoe:
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?
 
Phoenix:
I heard you say it!
 
Judge:
You did say it.
 
Edgeworth:
You said it.
 
Phoenix:
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?
 
Gumshoe:
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...
 
Judge:
That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?
 
Gumshoe:
Umm...
 
Phoenix:
(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)
 
Gumshoe:
... Yes.
 
Phoenix:
(Gah!)
 
Gumshoe:
Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!
 
Judge:
Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.
 
Witness Testimony
-- Hard Evidence --
Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
How you like that? That's my "hard evidence"!
 
Judge:
Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.
 
Gumshoe:
Y-Your Honor?
 
Judge:
Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?
 
Gumshoe:
Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.
 
Judge:
Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.
 
Phoenix:
OBJECTION!
 
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?
 
Gumshoe:
Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?
 
Phoenix:
You have it backwards, Detective.
 
Gumshoe:
B-backwards?
 
Phoenix:
The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. "Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object." She died immediately!
 
Gumshoe:
But...!
 
Phoenix:
No "but"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!
 
Judge:
Order! Order! The defense has a point.
 
Judge:
Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.
 
Edgeworth:
OBJECTION!
 
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?
 
Phoenix:
Wh-when...!?
 
Judge:
The prosecution's point being...?
 
Edgeworth:
That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor.
 
Phoenix:
Wh-what!?
 
Edgeworth:
A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! "Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow." I received these results this morning.
 
Phoenix:
N-no way!
 
Edgeworth:
Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write "Maya"! That is all.
 
Judge:
I see!
 
Phoenix:
(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)
 
Edgeworth:
Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?
 
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.
 
Judge:
U-understood. The court accepts the evidence.
 
Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.
 
Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.
 
Judge:
I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.
 
Phoenix:
(Darn! This isn't good!)
 
Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!
 
Judge:
Let the witness Miss April May take the stand.
 
Phoenix:
(Exactly what part of her is "innocent"...?)
 
Edgeworth:
Witness, your name, please.
 
April:
April May! At your service! *wink*
 
Judge:
Order! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wonton * winking!
 
April:
Aww... Yes, Your Honor.
 
Phoenix:
(This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)
 
Edgeworth:
Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?
 
April:
Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.
 
Edgeworth:
And this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?
 
April:
Mmm... that's right, big boy.
 
Judge:
Please testify to the court about what you saw.
 
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
April:
It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!
And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!
Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!
But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!
Then the woman with long hair...
She kinda... slumped.
The end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*
 
Judge:
Hmm...
 
Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor?
 
Judge:
I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...
 
Phoenix:
W-wait, Your Honor!
 
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
 
Phoenix:
What about my cross-examination!?
 
Judge:
I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?
 
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...
 
Phoenix:
H-hey! How dare you!
 
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?
 
Judge:
Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!
 
Phoenix:
OBJECTION!
 
Phoenix:
(Hmm... that's it? Nothing really jumps out as a contradiction... There's got to be something in there somewhere! Maybe I'd better just press her on the facts a bit!)
 
Phoenix:
Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!
 
April:
W-what!?
 
Phoenix:
Miss May, I'm willing to bet that...
 
Phoenix:
You're lying!
 
April:
Urp!
 
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What's the meaning of this?
 
April:
Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean!
 
Phoenix:
Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!
 
April:
...!
 
Phoenix:
No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!
 
April:
But... but!
 
Judge:
Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...
 
Phoenix:
She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?
 
April:
Rowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.
 
Judge:
Miss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony.
 
April:
I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink*
 
Judge:
Your testimony again, if you would.
 
Phoenix:
(Damn, I almost had her!)
 
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
 
April:
I did see everything! I did!
The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.
Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...
And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!
That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? "The Thinker," I think?
Well? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee!
 
Judge:
I... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination.
 
Phoenix:
(Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.)
 
Phoenix:
Miss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.
 
April:
Revealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...
 
Phoenix:
You just said that this statue of "The Thinker" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!
 
April:
Urp!
 
Phoenix:
Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a "clock," too... And he was found guilty... of murder!
 
Judge:
Order! Order!
 
Phoenix:
Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?
 
April:
Oooh... urp!
 
Edgeworth:
OBJECTION!
 
Edgeworth:
The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!
 
Judge:
Yes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.
 
Phoenix:
OBJECTION!
 
Phoenix:
But questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...)
 
Judge:
... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.
 
Phoenix:
(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)
 
April:
Huh? What? So... what happens now?
 
Phoenix:
What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?
 
April:
What...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!
 
Phoenix:
So, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.!
 
April:
N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!
 
Edgeworth:
The law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!
 
Judge:
Hmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?
 
Phoenix:
No, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because...
 
Phoenix:
Your Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang!
 
Judge:
This clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this?
 
Phoenix:
It is as you can see. The "clock" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar!
 
April:
F-fat!?
 
Phoenix:
Well, Miss May?
 
Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk.
 
Phoenix:
?
 
Edgeworth:
Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright.
 
Phoenix:
(He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!)
 
Edgeworth:
I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!
 
Judge:
! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.
 
Edgeworth:
And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!
 
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?
 
Edgeworth:
Ho hoh! Impossible, of course...
 
Phoenix:
I have proof.
 
Edgeworth:
W-what!?
 
Phoenix:
Wasn't it you who told me "proof is everything"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the "proof" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...
 
Phoenix:
Take a look at this!
 
Judge:
Hmm. That's a very cute cell phone.
 
April:
Ooh hoo! You have a girlie phone!
 
Phoenix:
W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!
 
Judge:
Order! Order!
 
Edgeworth:
The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!
 
Phoenix:
Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?
 
Edgeworth:
*grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)
 
Phoenix:
(My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.) Let's hear the conversation.
 
Cellular:
*beep*
...
Maya:
[So you just want me to hold on to "The Thinker" for you, then?]
 
Mia:
[If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.]
 
Maya:
[Huh? It's not working? That's lame!]
 
Mia:
[I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.]
 
…
 
[September 5, 9:27 AM]
Cellular:
*beep*
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone... and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!
 
April:
Muh... muh... muh!?
 
Phoenix:
Well, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?
 
April:
... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*
 
Judge:
So the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?
 
Phoenix:
The witness claims she had "seen it before." But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!

Judge:
Well then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.

Phoenix:
It's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!

April:
W-whaaat!?

Phoenix:
A friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!

April:
I-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!

Phoenix:
Miss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?

April:
Mmpf...

Phoenix:
Oh? Excuses not on sale today?

April:
Oooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!

Judge:
W-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!

April:
Hrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*

Phoenix:
(S-scary...)

Judge:
Miss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?

April:
...

Judge:
Hmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?

Phoenix:
(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...

Judge:
Well, does the defense have anything to say?

Phoenix:
Um, well... (Come on, think of something!)

Judge:
Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!

Edgeworth:
I believe we're ready for the witness to testify. He certainly does look like a bellboy.

Bellboy:
Yes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service.

Judge:
That tea set looks rather heavy, so without further ado, the witness may begin his testimony.

Bellboy:
Very good, sir!

Witness Testimony
-- Miss May's Room Service --
Bellboy:
I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!
I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.
She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.
I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.
And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.

Judge:
I see. The defense may begin its cross-examination.

Phoenix:
R-right! I'm ready. (I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!)

Phoenix:
(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!)

Phoenix:
... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?)

Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here!

Judge:
Hmm. It was a bit tedious. The witness may leave the stand.

Phoenix:
(I can't let this happen... can I?)

Phoenix:
W-wait! Please wait!

Judge:
Yes? Does the defense have something to add?

Phoenix:
One last question... let me ask one last question!

Edgeworth:
OBJECTION!

Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough!

Judge:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all.

Phoenix:
(Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?)

Edgeworth:
I object! That was... objectionable!

Judge:
... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question.

Bellboy:
Er... yes, I see.

Phoenix:
Why did you not mention this in your testimony!?

Bellboy:
W-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask!

Phoenix:
(Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!

Bellboy:
Ah, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...

Phoenix:
!

Bellboy:
He asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.

Edgeworth:
Oof! Y-you fool!

Phoenix:
I've done it... I've won!

Phoenix:
Miss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?

Bellboy:
Yes, sir.

Phoenix:
Then, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?

Bellboy:
That's right, sir.

Judge:
Hmm...

Phoenix:
Your Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?

Edgeworth:
Who! Who is this "other person"!

Phoenix:
Simple, it was...
Phoenix:
The man who checked in with Miss May!

Edgeworth:
Oof!

Phoenix:
Your Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!!

Edgeworth:
M-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late...

Phoenix:
"Too late"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court!

Edgeworth:
Oof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous!

Judge:
Enough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood?

Edgeworth:
Yes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor.

Judge:
That is all today for the trial of Maya Fey. Court is adjourned!

September 7, 2:24 PM
District Court
Defendant Lobby No. 1
Maya:
Mr. Wright! You were amazing in there!

Phoenix:
R-really?

Maya:
I think I might be your newest fan!

Phoenix:
Oh, I was just "doing my job" you know... heh heh.

Maya:
Then again, that other attorney was pretty cool, too...

Phoenix:
Huh?

Maya:
That face of his! With his eyes wide, and trembling lips! It sent shivers up my spine!

Phoenix:
Hmm... if you say so.

Maya:
So, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now?

Phoenix:
Well, no. I don't think so. Not yet.

Maya:
Oh... I see.

Phoenix:
But I got a great lead in today's trial!

Maya:
A "lead"?

Phoenix:
That man with Miss May! He's the key!

Maya:
Oh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway?

Phoenix:
I heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed.

Maya:
Yes sir!

Phoenix:
I'm going to find out more about this man.

Maya:
Do you think he was the one who...?

Phoenix:
Maybe so.

Maya:
Sis...

Phoenix:
Don't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise.

Maya:
I'm counting on you!

Phoenix:
I asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.

May Testimony added to the Court Record.

Phoenix:
I don't know how much good this will do me at all, now. Anyway, time to hit the pavement and do some investigating! Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to get her free!

December 26, 9:44 AM
District Court
Defendant Lobby No. 2
Phoenix:
Karma...?

Edgeworth:
That's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!

Maya:
Not a single case?

Edgeworth:
He'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.

Phoenix:
Hmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.

Edgeworth:
Hmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.

Phoenix:
(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)

Edgeworth:
He taught me what it really means to "prosecute."

Phoenix:
Wh-what!?

Edgeworth:
Just picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.

Maya:
Ugh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?

Edgeworth:
Something like that...

Maya:
And now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.

Edgeworth:
Not a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!

Maya:
That's pretty ruthless...

Edgeworth:
Like I said. He's a god among prosecutors.

Phoenix:
(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?

Maya:
Uh huh?

Phoenix:
We could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?

Maya:
Oh...

Phoenix:
?

Maya:
I can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach.

Phoenix:
You couldn't "reach"?

Maya:
I think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again...

Phoenix:
Oh man, what bad timing!

Maya:
I'm really sorry. I'll try my best!

Phoenix:
I hope so!

Edgeworth:
What are you whispering about?

Phoenix:
O-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in...

December 26, 10:00 AM
District Court
Courtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.

Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.

Karma:
...

Judge:
Err, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?

Karma:
... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?

Judge:
R-right, my apologies!

Phoenix:
(He's even got the Judge scared!)

Judge:
Very well, your opening statement, please.

Karma:
... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?

Judge:
Ah... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness.

Maya:
What's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?

Phoenix:
How am I supposed to fight against this!?

Karma:
I call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.

Phoenix:
(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)

Karma:
Describe the incident. Now!

Gumshoe:
Y-yessir!

Phoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)

Gumshoe:
Er, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.

Karma:
Hmm.

Overhead Map added to the Court Record.

Karma:
Testify to the court about your arrest. Now!

Judge:
W-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...

Karma:
Yes?

Judge:
Actually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings...

Karma:
Wrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word "guilty." That is your role!

Judge:
Y-yes, of course. You're quite right.

Phoenix:
(No he's not!!!)

Witness Testimony
-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --
Gumshoe:
A man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.
We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.
That's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.
Now, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.
But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.
So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.

Judge:
Hmm... I see. Very well...

Karma:
Begin your cross-examination, attorney. Now!

Judge:
...

Maya:
Nick. Doesn't it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague?

Phoenix:
I bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.

Maya:
What do we do?

Phoenix:
Grit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?

Maya:
Well said, Nick! You're the man!

Karma:
Members of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective!

Gumshoe:
Y-y-yessir!

Karma:
Was the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?

Gumshoe:
Yes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.

Judge:
Hmm...

Maya:
Hey, Nick! What does he mean, "ballistic markings"?

Karma:
Shocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!

Maya:
N-Nick! He's glaring at me!

Karma:
Tsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.

Judge:
Eh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the "fingerprints" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these "ballistic fingerprints" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.

Karma:
Indeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!

Judge:
O-order! Order!

Phoenix:
(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)

Karma:
Well, Judge?

Judge:
I'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...

Karma:
You wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!

Judge:
Y-yes?

Karma:
What are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!

Judge:
B-but, wait, I...

Karma:
Just bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!

Judge:
Y-yes! Ahem. This court will take a ten minute recess.

Phoenix:
(Who's running this court, anyway!?)

December 26, 11:09 AM
District Court
Defendant Lobby No. 2
Phoenix:
Edgeworth! What's going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!

Edgeworth:
Uh... hmm...

Phoenix:
And that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!

Edgeworth:
True...

Phoenix:
Was that you in the boat?

Edgeworth:
... Yes. It was me.

Phoenix:
What!?

Edgeworth:
But... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.

Phoenix:
Th-then who did!?

Edgeworth:
I... don't know.

Phoenix:
You don't know!? Weren't you right there!?

Edgeworth:
... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!

Phoenix:
Y-you mean it was a suicide!?

Edgeworth:
... That's the only explanation I can come up with.

Phoenix:
Huh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?

Maya:
Huh? Wh-what?

Phoenix:
Any progress with Mia?

Maya:
Oh... Sorry. It's no good.

Phoenix:
Ugh...

Maya:
I know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?

Maya:
I don't know anything about trials, or defense... What's more, I'm a spirit medium who can't even contact spirits...

Phoenix:
Aww, everyone has their off days! I mean, I've just been getting lucky lately... But you never know when my luck is going to run out!

Maya:
Really...?

Edgeworth:
W-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart...

Phoenix:
Oh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!)

Judge:
Court is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness.

Karma:
Yes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?

Karma:
Lotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?

Lotta:
That I am.

Karma:
Good. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?

Lotta:
... Y'all need to learn some manners.

Karma:
UNDERSTAND?

Lotta:
Y-yeah, I understand, I understand!

Judge:
Er... very well. Your testimony, please.

Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
Lotta:
It was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.
I was in my car.
I heard this "bang" come up from the lake.
When I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.
Then there was another "bang"...
There wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.

Karma:
Enough.

Lotta:
Huh?

Karma:
Judge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.

Judge:
W-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!

Karma:
As the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!

Judge:
Order! Order! Order...! I will have order!

Karma:
... Well, Judge?

Judge:
The evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...

Phoenix:
OBJECTION!

Phoenix:
W-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!

Karma:
A cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read "guilty"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?

Phoenix:
...!

Karma:
Very well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!

Maya:
Uh, Nick... contempt...?

Phoenix:
"Contempt of court," you know?

Maya:
I... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?

Phoenix:
I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!

Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Very well!

Judge:
I pray for your sake this isn't a waste of time.

Judge:
Enough! I think we've heard all we need to hear, Mr. Wright. It seems you are unable to find a contradiction in the testimony worth noting.

Phoenix:
B-but, Your Honor!

Karma:
You keep your promise!

Judge:
Mr. Wright. I am afraid that I will have to penalize any further outbursts... By holding you in contempt of court!

Karma:
And if that happens, you'll have to leave the courtroom immediately! Understood...?

Phoenix:
Uh... uh huh.

Maya:
Nick...! Lotta's testimony is fishy, Nick! Real fishy!

Phoenix:
I... know what you mean. But... If I can't say anything, what can I do?

Judge:
I believe we've covered the evidence sufficiently to make a decision.

Karma:
Then, pass your judgment!

Judge:
Very well. Mr. Miles Edgeworth, please take the stand.

Maya:
HOLD IT!

Judge:
Wh-who was that!?

Maya:
It... was me.

Phoenix:
(Maya!)

Judge:
I-is something wrong? D-do you need to use the facilities?

Maya:
No, I do not! Lotta Hart! Your testimony stinks! It's unclear whether you were actually looking at the lake! It's highly doubtful that you actually say Mr. Edgeworth! Tell us the truth! This is a matter of life or death!

Lotta:
...!

Maya:
Lotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!?

Judge:
You will stand down! The court does not acknowledge the defense's outburst!

Maya:
Answer me, Lotta!

Lotta:
What's the big idea, treating me like some kind of criminal!? I saw him! I swear it! I saw Edgeworth...

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
Enough! Judge... Declare the defense in contempt of court!

Judge:
Y-yes... yes, of course. I'm sorry, but you WERE warned. Guard! Escort Mr. Wright out of the courtroom! He is in contempt of court, and must leave.

Phoenix:
(No... No...!)

Wait!
Maya:
I-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent!

Karma:
Hah! What's the difference? All that remains is for the guilty verdict to be declared! Isn't that right, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?

Phoenix:
Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said? She said she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth! That was not in the testimony! That changes her testimony, and I have a right to cross-examine her again!

Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order!

Karma:
You're in contempt of court! It's too late for wild claims! Judge! Sustain my objection!

Judge:
... ... I'm sorry, Mr. von Karma, but I cannot.

Karma:
What!?

Judge:
Ms. Lotta Hart has made a new testimony. The defense does have a right to cross-examine her again.

Karma:
B-but he is in contempt of court!

Maya:
No, I am! If you're going to arrest someone, arrest me!

Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Maya Fey! You will leave the courtroom immediately.

Maya:
Nick! I did what I could... You have to do the rest! Good luck!

Phoenix:
M-Maya...!

Karma:
Peh! I care not for this melodrama! Listen well, Mr. Wright! I do not tolerate badgering of my witnesses!

Phoenix:
(I'm running out of time... I'd better find a contradiction in here or else...)

Judge:
Mr. Wright! Begin your cross-examination!

Cross Examination
-- That Last Statement --
Lotta:
I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!

Phoenix:
(That's it...? Uh oh. I don't know if I can find anything in that... What will Maya say...?)

Phoenix:
Got you. Got you, Ms. Hart! Finally!

Lotta:
Wh-what!? You got what?

Phoenix:
Look at this photograph.

Lotta:
The photo I took...?

Phoenix:
The very same. There's something I want you to see in this photo... it's quite clearly visible. The fog, Ms. Hart.

Lotta:
So... so?

Phoenix:
This picture was taken with professional, high quality film, correct? Yet even it could not capture the faces of the men on the boat! Yet you claim you saw Mr. Edgeworth! How!?

Lotta:
Whut!? Wha--!

Judge:
Mr. Wright has a point!

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
That's why I told her not to say that in her testimony! Please!

Phoenix:
Yet, now she has said it, Mr. von Karma. How could you possibly see Mr. Edgeworth!? Explain yourself!

Judge:
Ms. Hart.

Lotta:
What!

Judge:
Could you see the defendant that night?

Lotta:
O-of course! I said I could and I meant I could!

Judge:
Then, please testify as to the circumstances of your sighting.

Phoenix:
(I did it! I finally found a hole in von Karma's carefully vague testimony!)

Witness Testimony
-- How Edgeworth Was Seen --
Lotta:
Yer right. It was a cold night, and the fog was thick as grits.
So, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car.
Still, I brought my binoculars with me.
When I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.
See? No problem!

Judge:
Hmm...You used binoculars? Very well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.

Phoenix:
(This one'd better be good!)

Phoenix:
(I don't care how many von Karmic objections I get... I'm going to find a hole in this testimony if it's the last thing I do!)

Lotta:
Ooof!

Judge:
Mr. Wright! What are you driving at?

Phoenix:
The witness was not at the lake to photograph shooting stars, Your Honor!

Lotta:
...!

Judge:
W-well then, what exactly was she photographing?

Phoenix:
Your Honor! Take a look at this... What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?

Phoenix:
Ms. Hart. This is what you were trying to photograph!

Judge:
What's this? A newspaper article? "Gourdy"...? Ah, the sighting at Gourd Lake...

Phoenix:
Well, Ms. Hart?

Lotta:
I... I never heard of no lake monster! You got proof or something? Let's see you prove that I was down at the lake trying to photograph this "Gourdy."

Judge:
Very well, let's see it. And... no joking around this time, please. Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!

Judge:
Order! Order! I see... I, too, thought it was a little strange.

Phoenix:
(Yeah, sure!) Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a photo of Gourdy, weren't you?

Lotta:
... Yeah. Not bad. Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what?

Phoenix:
Huh...?

Lotta:
That don't change what I saw, does it?

Karma:
Exactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist!

Lotta:
H-hey!

Karma:
But, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing!

Phoenix:
(Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I'm getting to the bottom of this!)

Judge:
Ms. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony.

Lotta:
... Right. Fine, I'll testify. It won't change nothing, though.

Phoenix:
(Something will change... it has to! And I'm going to spot it!)

Karma:
...

Witness Testimony
-- Lotta's New Testimony --
Lotta:
Actually, I'm not a research student at a university.
I'm an investigative photographer.
Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!
That's why I was camping out by the lake.
But, that's all I was hiding.
When I heard the "bang" I looked right straight out at that lake.
There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.
Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot.
I was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry.

Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
The witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination!

Judge:
Er... hmm.

Phoenix:
OBJECTION!

Phoenix:
I claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?)

Judge:
Very well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind.

Karma:
Hah! That would be a first!

Phoenix:
(Hah hah, very funny.)

Judge:
You understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood?

Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.

Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Were you REALLY looking at that boat!?

Lotta:
W-what's with you!? Course I was looking at it! It was the only thing out there! Any normal person'd be looking at it!

Phoenix:
I agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal!

Lotta:
Wh-what!? Y'all wanna step over here and say that!?

Phoenix:
You were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You'd be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that's what! You wouldn't give the boat a second thought!

Lotta:
Aah!

Judge:
Order! Continue, Mr. Wright!

Phoenix:
You testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn't need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for Gourdy... and that's what you were doing!

Lotta:
...! ... ...

Phoenix:
Well!?

Lotta:
Hmph... Well, now that y'all mention it... I did sort of take my binoculars and kind of scan the lake a bit... I mean, Gourdy might be out there, n' all...

Judge:
M-Ms. Hart! A-are you saying that you were NOT watching the boat, then?

Lotta:
... S-sorry, y'all. I wasn't fibbing, really. I was, just... I thought y'know, I could be witness to a murder n' all! I kinda got excited. I was sure I was watching that boat... till now.

Judge:
... This... this is totally uncalled for--

Lotta:
B-but hey! You got the photograph! You got proof!

Judge:
Hmm... Still, we can't see who is shooting who in this.

Lotta:
Right! Right! That's why I took this photo n'...

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
Witness... That's enough. You've had a long day. Shut your pie-hole.

Lotta:
Sh-shut my what!?

Phoenix:
(What was she going to say? She took the photo... and what? Wait a second...)

Gumshoe:
She even had a photograph to prove it.

Phoenix:
But you really can't tell from the photo who is shooting.

Gumshoe:
That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said "it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!"

Phoenix:
(She enlarged that photo! Why won't von Karma let her show it? I've got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I'm wrong, though, it'll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse. What should I do!?)

Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph. You enlarged this photograph, did you not?

Lotta:
Y-yeah! I did!

Phoenix:
Why has that enlargement not been presented to the court!?

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
B-because it does not exist!

Lotta:
What're y'all talking about!? You were the one who told me not to show it in court in the first place! You old fool!

Judge:
What's the meaning of this, Mr. von Karma!

Karma:
Er... erm...

Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Show the photo to the court! Show us the enlargement!

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
The prosecution objects to the submission of this evidence!

Judge:
Objection... denied. The witness will show the enlargement to the court.

Lotta:
Here it is.

Judge:
Hmm. We still cannot see who is firing in this. It could be the defendant... or maybe it's not. Regardless, I'll accept this as evidence.

Lake Photo added to the Court Record.

Karma:
Happy now, Mr. Wright?

Phoenix:
Hmm... (There has to be something!)

Karma:
You asked for the enlargement, you got the enlargement. And little good it has done any of us! That's why I requested she not show it!

Judge:
Hmm... I suppose this means that the cross-examination...

Karma:
Is over! Obviously!

Judge:
Then, I would like to close the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart.

Karma:
And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time.

Judge:
Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add?

Karma:
I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required?

Judge:
Nothing, of course. Then, I believe it is time for me to declare my verdict.

Phoenix:
(Wait... it's not supposed to go like this! There has to be a clue in this photo... somewhere! This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?)

Phoenix:
Your Honor! There is something decidedly strange with this enlargement!

Judge:
W-what might that be? Mr. Wright... You will show the court what you mean! What about this photo is "strange"?

Phoenix:
(Okay... here goes nothing! I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.)

Phoenix:
Here, Your Honor!

Judge:
The shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange?

Phoenix:
Look at the hand holding the pistol, Your Honor!

Judge:
The hand...?

Phoenix:
That hand directly contradicts another piece of evidence!

Judge:
This man's left hand does what...!?

Phoenix:
Let me show you. I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!

Phoenix:
The evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in his left hand. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth's "right hand"! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!!

Judge:
Now that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright.

Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.

Judge:
You have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn't do it, then who shot our victim?

Karma:
Precisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night! Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?

Phoenix:
There is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!!

Judge:
Order! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide?

Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation.

Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option.

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question.

Phoenix:
Wh-what!?

Karma:
An examination of the victim's wound reveals the distance at which he was shot.

Phoenix:
The... distance?

Karma:
The victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away!

Phoenix:
A meter! Th-that's three feet!

Karma:
There is no way it could have been suicide!

Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. von Karma! Are you sure of the accuracy of your data!?

Karma:
Of course! I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see.

Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.

Judge:
Hmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day. The court orders the defense and the prosecution to further investigate this matter. Understood?

Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.

Karma:
...

Judge:
That is all. The court is adjourned.

December 27, 10:00 AM
District Court
Courtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.

Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.

Karma:
... ...

Judge:
Very well, apparently the prosecution is also ready.

Phoenix:
(Who is the judge here, anyway!?)

Judge:
Mr. von Karma, your opening statement.

Karma:
... ...

Judge:
Er... very well, no opening statement so...

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
Not so fast, Judge! I was taking a meaningful pause before speaking!

Judge:
R-right, of course.

Karma:
A prediction! Today's trial will end three minutes from now!

Judge:
Order... order! Mr. von Karma! What is the meaning of your statement just now!?

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
Bah! Must you question everything! It will be over in three minutes! We have no time to waste! I'll call my witness now!

Judge:
R-right...

Karma:
I call my witness... my decisive witness to the stand!

Phoenix:
(It's that mysterious boat shop owner.)

Karma:
Witness... state your profession.

Uncle:
Mmph... zzzz... ... I, er, am the proprietor of the restaurant the "Wet Noodle" at Gourd Lake.

Karma:
...

Uncle:
And I, er, also rent boats.

Karma:
The night of the incident, you were in the boat rental shop, correct?

Uncle:
Er... ayup, yup I was.

Karma:
Please testify.

Phoenix:
(Wait a second... We still haven't heard who this old guy is!)

Phoenix:
Wait a minute! The witness hasn't stated his name yet!

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
Because I did not ask him, Mr. Wright! Bah! I have predicted this trial will end in three minutes! Stop asking trivial questions and cooperate!

Phoenix:
(Yeah, right!)

Judge:
The witness will state his name.

Uncle:
Zzzz... ... Mmph! Well, er... I'm not really sure, ayup.

Judge:
What do you mean?

Uncle:
My, er, memory...

Karma:
Your honor... The witness does not remember anything beyond the last several years... Ergo, he cannot recall his own name.

Judge:
Hmm... he can't recall, you say?

Karma:
Yes, but the incident in question took place three days ago. He can testify.

Judge:
Very well. Let's hear his testimony then, shall we. Witness?

Witness Testimony
-- The Night of the Murder --
Uncle:
It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.
I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.
Then I heard a "bang!" Ayup.
When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.
Then I heard another "bang."
Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.

Judge:
Hmm...Very well. I'd like to begin the cross-examination...

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
There is nothing to question in my witness's testimony! Ergo, no need for cross-examination! Besides, there are only 10 seconds left before our three minutes are up! Judge! Your verdict, now!

Judge:
Er... yes... M-Mr. Wright...?

Karma:
Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

Judge:
E-excuse me? Mr. von Karma?

Karma:
Three minutes just passed.

Judge:
I see. Well then, let's just take our time. You may cross-examine the witness.

Phoenix:
(If I know von Karma, he spent time preparing his witness. I'm not going to find contradictions very easily in this testimony. Whew... it's tough being a lawyer.)

Phoenix:
A-are you sure!?

Uncle:
...

Phoenix:
(Uh oh!) D-Dad!

Uncle:
Dead certain, Keith! He said "I can't believe he's dead" as he was walking by, too.

Karma:
Witness! Are you sure that the person you saw was Miles Edgeworth!?

Uncle:
It was him! That Edgeworth boy!

Judge:
... This... sounds like decisive evidence indeed. I see no room for doubt.

Phoenix:
(von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!)

Karma:
Tsk, tsk, tsk...

Maya:
N-Nick...! I don't like the way things are going here! Everyone in the courtroom is glaring at us!

Phoenix:
(I'd better act quick, or this trial is going to be over!)

Phoenix:
It's no good! There's nothing I can do.

Maya:
A... are you sure?

Phoenix:
To be honest... I don't know what to do anymore.

Maya:
Please... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you...

Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn't bad! This must be a new record.

Judge:
Enough! The witness may leave the stand.

Uncle:
Zzzz...

Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.

Phoenix:
(W-what!? No!)

Karma:
Hmph.

Judge:
This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...

Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!

W-w-waaaaaaait!

Judge:
Wh-who was that just now?

Me!!!

Phoenix:
Huh? Waaaaah! L-Larry!

Judge:
Wh-what are you doing here!?

Butz:
Listen! Y-you gotta listen to me! I... I was... I was there, in the park, the night of the murder! I... I wasn't sure about it until just yesterday. B-but today I remembered it!

Judge:
Remembered what?

Butz:
The gunshot! I heard it too!

Judge:
O-order!

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
What is the meaning of this!? The verdict has been decided! I call for adjournment!

Judge:
One moment, Mr. von Karma. So, you say you heard a gunshot?

Butz:
Yeah, I did! A gunshot! That night! I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember! A-anyhow, I can't just sit here and let you call Edgey a murderer! It's... It's just not right! I'll testify! Lemme testify!

Judge:
Order! Order! Well, this is the first time something has happened like this in my court. I'm not quite sure how to proceed...

Karma:
Judge! You've already given your decision! The trial is over!

Maya:
Nick! This is it! Larry's given us one final chance at this!

Phoenix:
(She's right! If only it wasn't Larry... He could make things even worse...)

Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth was just declared guilty, Nick! It doesn't get any worse!

Phoenix:
You're right! Okay! Your Honor! If there is another witness, it is our duty to hear him speak! Right here! Right now!

Karma:
A waste of time! The verdict cannot be overturned!

Judge:
Hmm... ... ... Allow me to speak my opinion. In all court proceedings, it is our duty to prevent an inaccurate verdict. In order to make sure no mistake has been made, every witness should be heard!

Karma:
Wh-what is this!?

Judge:
I withdraw my previous verdict of "guilty"! Mr. von Karma! I order you to call this new witness to testify. Now!

Karma:
Whaaaat!

Judge:
The court will adjourn for a five minute recess. After that, we will hear this new witness. Court is adjourned!

December 27, 10:35 AM
District Court
Courtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court is now back in session. Witness... Please testify to the court about everything that you saw... on the night of December 24th.

Butz:
Right... leave it to me!

Phoenix:
(Please, Larry, don't mess this one up!!! I hate to admit it, but you're our last chance!)

Karma:
...

Phoenix:
(von Karma didn't even have time to prep his witness. I just hope Edgeworth is right about this being our big break...)

Witness Testimony
-- The Night of the Murder --
Butz:
That night, I was out in a boat on the lake.
I was looking for something and I, er, found it.
So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.
Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this "bang"!
I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.
So after I heard that single gunshot I went home.

Judge:
Hmm... That was an unusually vague testimony, even for this court. In any matter, Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.

Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor...

Maya:
What's wrong, Nick?

Phoenix:
It's Larry! I have no idea what he's going to say if I press him. I'm a little scared.

Maya:
Hmm... Well, we've come this far. There's no way to go but forward, Nick!

Maya:
Well, Nick?

Phoenix:
Hmm... It was a pretty wishy-washy testimony, wasn't it? I guess I should just start working on the contradictions.

Maya:
Sorry... I wish I could be more helpful. I wish I could call my sister...

Phoenix:
W-wait a sec, Larry!

Butz:
Wh-what!?

Phoenix:
You only heard one "bang"!? You're sure!?

Butz:
That's what I said!

Phoenix:
But Mr. Lotta Hart testified yesterday that she heard two "bang"s! And the old man just now said the same thing! They both heard two gunshots that night!

Butz:
Huh?

Phoenix:
Were you even listening!? Were you paying attention at all to what they said?

Butz:
Yo, Nick, please!

Phoenix:
Huh?

Butz:
You know, something's been bothering me. I'm a witness, see? I'm like a customer here! So you got to treat me nice and stuff, okay!?

Phoenix:
...

Judge:
Mr. Butz.

Butz:
What!?

Judge:
You only heard one gunshot? Are you sure?

Butz:
... Umm... Well, to tell ya the truth... I'm not sure.

Judge:
Eh...?

Phoenix:
Not sure!? H-how could you not be sure?

Butz:
Yeah, well... I, uh, I might have missed the other gunshot. I was, uh, listening to something else...

Phoenix:
Something... else?

Butz:
My radio, dude! On my headphones.

Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaat!?

Judge:
Order! Order! And stop that booing! M-Mr. Butz! You were listening to a radio on earphones?

Butz:
Y-yeah! So what! That a crime!? I listen to my radio! Everybody listens to the radio! What's the big deal!?

Judge:
Hmm... Mr. von Karma... your opinion?

Karma:
Waste of time. I do not accept this witness, nor his shoddy testimony.

Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Should he continue the testimony?

Phoenix:
Your Honor. Please... please allow the witness to continue his testimony.

Karma:
Bah! Nothing is more pitiful than a lawyer who doesn't know when he's lost!

Judge:
Very well, Mr. Butz. Please give your testimony, and be sure to include details like your RADIO.

Butz:
Right! Leave it to me!

Phoenix:
(I wouldn't if there were any other way out of this, believe me.)

Witness Testimony
-- What Larry Heard --
Butz:
It's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve!
That's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see?
I was listening to it real booming loud, like.
But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!
I remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.

Judge:
You were listening to your radio... at a high volume!?

Butz:
Yeah, what's the big problem? Can't a man listen to his radio in peace? Isn't this a free country!?

Phoenix:
(I truly believe Larry has no idea what the problem is.)

Karma:
Judge. Can you believe a word this witness says? What he heard was probably nothing more than a drum beat from the radio!

Judge:
True enough, it is difficult to believe this testimony.

Phoenix:
OBJECTION!

Phoenix:
Wait, Your Honor! The witness said he remembers exactly what the DJ said when he heard the gunshot!

Judge:
Excuse me? "Dee-jay"...?

Phoenix:
An announcer... the guy who says things on the radio. Anyway! What this means is, when he heard the sound, no music was playing! The DJ only talks between songs! So he could have heard the gunshot from the lake! I'd like to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor!

Judge:
V-very well, Mr. Wright.

Phoenix:
(I can't believe I'm continuing this charade...)

Phoenix:
(This is the most ludicrous testimony I've ever heard. But there is one gleaming ray of hope in there! I've got to press it until we get to the bottom of what happened!)

Phoenix:
This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!

Judge:
Order! Order! What does this mean? The two prior witnesses heard gunshots after midnight. However, this witness says he heard a gunshot before midnight...

Karma:
Judge. The answer is simple. The current witness is plainly mistaken. Just look at him! Suspicious!

Butz:
Wh-whaaat!?

Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think about Mr. Butz's claim that he heard the gunshot before midnight?

Phoenix:
Larry's not mistaken, Your Honor! He heard that gunshot before midnight!

Karma:
... Intriguing. I'm assuming you have evidence for this wild claim? Show me evidence there was a gunshot before midnight!

Phoenix:
Look at this photograph! This was taken by our witness yesterday, Ms. Lotta Hart, with her automatic camera. The timestamp on the photo reads "December 24, 11:50 PM."

Judge:
Oh yeah? Hmm? But, there's nothing on the lake in this picture.

Phoenix:
Your Honor. The real issue here is not why nothing is shown in the photograph. It is why this photograph exists at all!

Judge:
What do you mean?

Phoenix:
Your Honor... This photograph was taken by an automatic camera. That camera was set to go off in response to loud noises!

Judge:
Ahah!

Phoenix:
Correct! There was a loud noise on the lake at 11:50 PM. That is why this photograph was taken! In other words... When Larry heard that gunshot, it was most definitely Christmas Eve!

Judge:
Indeed, it would seem that is the case! Then... where does that leave us? Ms. Hart testified that she heard the gunshots after midnight. Are you claiming she was mistaken?

Phoenix:
Not at all, Your Honor. It is a fact that the camera also triggered at 15 minutes after midnight! Your Honor! That night, there were two sets of gunshots, with a 25 minute pause between them!

Judge:
Why would this be...?

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
Don't be fooled, Judge! That camera was set to respond to "loud noises"!

Judge:
Yes?

Karma:
There is no proof that the "loud noise" at 11:50 was a gunshot! Why, the witness could have sneezed, triggering the camera!

Butz:
H-hey, my noise was clear that night, man! Clear!

Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? There's no turning back now. Can you prove that the "loud noise" at 11:50 PM was indeed a gunshot? Please show the court evidence if you have any.

Phoenix:
This is my evidence.

Judge:
The... murder weapon?

Phoenix:
Something about this pistol was bothering me, Your Honor. Both of the witnesses who testified yesterday heard two gunshots. However, the murder weapon was fired three times. When, then, was the last shot fired? Only now have I realized the truth. That third shot was the shot Larry heard just before midnight!

Judge:
Order! Order! Hmm... That would make sense of the evidence we've seen so far. ... However... This leaves me wondering exactly what did happen that night on the lake.

Karma:
Exactly! If this is true, there were two sets of gunshots, separated by 25 minutes! One at 11:50, another at 15 minutes after midnight! Why, I ask you! Why!?

Phoenix:
(Uh oh, I'd better think of something quick! ... Wait a second...! Gunshots separated by 25 minutes...?) Aaaaaaaaaaah!

Maya:
Wh-what's wrong, Nick?

Phoenix:
I have it! I have it!

Maya:
Huh?

Phoenix:
Remember the case with the Steel Samurai!?

Maya:
Huh? Yeah, of course I remember...

Phoenix:
The murderer in this case had the same idea as the murderer in that case!

Maya:
What do you mean?

Phoenix:
Maya!

Maya:
Yes!?

Phoenix:
If we don't figure this out now, we'll never overturn Edgeworth's guilty verdict! I've got a hunch, and I'm going to run with it...

Maya:
Right! I mean... is this safe?

Phoenix:
Safe? We've already gotten a guilty verdict! We have nothing to lose!

Maya:
...

Phoenix:
You just watch and let me know if I say anything that sounds fishy, okay?

Maya:
Right, Nick!

Phoenix:
Your Honor!

Judge:
Y-yes, Mr. Wright?

Phoenix:
The testimony just now has cleared up this entire case!

Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Wright!?

Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... So, you've finally realized the truth? There can be no other murderer here than Miles Edgeworth himself.

Phoenix:
Wrong, von Karma! A man was shot that night, but it wasn't Edgeworth who did the shooting!

Karma:
Listen, rookie. Take a deep breath, and consider the facts. At the time of the murder, one boat was on the lake. This was shown by the witness's photograph. The defendant, Edgeworth, and victim, Robert Hammond, were on that boat. There was a gunshot fired on that boat, and Robert Hammond fell into the lake. The distance of the shooting was one meter. It couldn't have been suicide! Well? The guilty party has to be the other man on that boat!

Judge:
I admit, it is hard to imagine any other possibility.

Phoenix:
Yes... But this assumes that the victim was shot at 15 minutes after midnight.

Judge:
... What do you mean by that, Mr. Wright? We have photographic evidence of the time of the shooting. The timestamp on the photo says 00:15.

Phoenix:
But Larry heard a gunshot 25 minutes before that! Robert Hammond was killed then! 25 minutes before the shot on the lake! (That's the only way that Edgeworth could be innocent!)

Judge:
...

Karma:
... Mr. Wright. Are you quite mad? Explain who this is sitting on the boat!

Phoenix:
Of course, it was Edgeworth and the murderer! After the murderer killed Robert Hammond at 11:50... He assumed the guise of Mr. Hammond and met Edgeworth!

Judge:
Wh... What!? Are you serious?

Phoenix:
Yes. Edgeworth won't tell us why he went to the lake that night. However, I have a hunch. That night, Robert Hammond called Edgeworth to the lake. Now, Edgeworth didn't know Robert Hammond's face that well. That's why he didn't suspect anything when the murderer took Robert Hammond's place!

Judge:
... I'm not sure what to make of all this.

Karma:
L-Ludicrous!

Judge:
Mr. Wright. Tell us the name of the murderer then!

Phoenix:
The murderer's name...? Right! It's...

Phoenix:
Actually, I don't know the murderer's name.

Judge:
Y-you don't know!?

Karma:
Bah! Again, you waste my time!

Phoenix:
I don't know because he never told us!

Karma:
...!

Phoenix:
The murderer is the caretaker of the boat shop, that old man! At 11:50, he was the one who killed Robert Hammond.

Judge:
The caretaker of the boat shop!? Wh-where did he do this!? There weren't any boats on the lake then!

Phoenix:
Why would he have to go all the way out on the lake just to shoot someone? May I suggest... That the real scene of the crime was not in a boat!

Judge:
What!? W-well then, where did the murder take place!?

Phoenix:
Here, of course! The boat shop, where he lives. That way he could meet with the victim without anyone seeing!

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
Do you have proof that the boat shop was the scene of the crime!?

Phoenix:
Recall Larry's testimony if you will. That night he was out on the lake in a boat, searching for something. He finds it, and returns the boat. Then, just as he's starting to head for home, he hears a gunshot! He heard a gunshot, Your Honor! Even though he was wearing headphones at the time! In other words, the gunshot was very, very close by! And where would that be if he had just returned a boat?

Judge:
The boat shop...! Mr. Wright! What happened that night on Gourd Lake!? Please tell the court, from the beginning!

Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor.

Maya:
Nick, are you sure about this...?

Phoenix:
Um, not really. But, I think if I start at the very beginning... And I take it slow, I must just be able to figure this out...

Phoenix:
That night... The caretaker of the boat shop called Robert Hammond to his shop. This was around 11:50. That was when the gunshot that Larry heard was fired. After that, the caretaker put on Robert Hammond's coat... He became Robert Hammond! Then he got in the boat with Edgeworth, and went out into the middle of the lake.

Judge:
Then... who fired the pistol on the boat, Mr. Wright?

Phoenix:
Of course, it was the murderer who shot the pistol. He shot twice. Both missed Edgeworth, on purpose.

Judge:
Wait a minute...

Phoenix:
Y-yes?

Judge:
Why would he shoot twice if he didn't mean to hit anyone?

Phoenix:
Uh... (Details! Details!)

Karma:
Know this, Mr. Wright. The moment you run out of explanations is the moment you lose. Tell us why the murderer had to fire twice!

Phoenix:
I believe he shot twice to create a witness, Your Honor.

Judge:
Create a witness...?

Phoenix:
The murderer lifts his pistol and fires one shot. That ensures that anyone who heard the shot would look at the lake. Indeed, Ms. Hart did exactly that after hearing the first gunshot. Next! The murderer waits a bit and he fires again. Then... The murderer jumps from the boat himself! Leaving the pistol in the boat behind him.

Judge:
... I see! To someone looking from the edge of the lake... It would appear that one of the men on the boat had shot the other!

Phoenix:
The murderer didn't know about the automatic camera, of course. That's why he shot twice to draw attention to the boat!

Judge:
Hmm...

Phoenix:
Once you realize that, everything else falls into place! The boat shop caretaker swam back to his shop. Then he put Mr. Hammond's coat back on the body. And threw the body into the lake! This is what happened, Your Honor. These are the events that transpired that night on Gourd Lake.

Judge:
...

Karma:
...

...

Judge:
... Bailiff! Bring out the witness from before! The boat shop caretaker! Quickly!

Judge:
Very well. While we are waiting for the caretaker... I would like to ask the defendant, Miles Edgeworth, a few questions. Mr. Edgeworth. Please take the stand.

Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth... You heard what the defense has said?

Edgeworth:
Yes.

Judge:
Well? Why did you go to the lake that night?

Edgeworth:
... What Wright has said was mostly correct. Astonishingly so, actually. Yes... Several days ago, I received a letter. The letter was signed, "Robert Hammond." He asked me to come to the boat shop by the lake at midnight on Christmas Eve. He said he had something very important to discuss with me.

Judge:
Something important?

Edgeworth:
... I'm sorry. I can't say what it was.

Judge:
Hmm...

Guard:
Your Honor, sir!

Judge:
Bailiff! We are conducting a trial here, I ask that you remain quiet...

Guard:
The witness has disappeared! He isn't at the boat shop, either!

Judge:
What!?

Guard:
What should I do?

Judge:
F-find him, quickly! We cannot allow him to get away!

Judge:
Mr. von Karma! Your witness has disappeared!

Karma:
... A search warrant has already been issued.

Judge:
Hmm... It goes without saying that I cannot declare a verdict under these circumstances. I will extend the trial until tomorrow, the final day allowed. I request that the police department utilize all its forces to find that witness! Am I understood?

Karma:
...

Judge:
One more thing. Just who is that boat shop caretaker? I think his identity has become very important to this trial. I want him, and I want to know who he is.

Karma:
...

Judge:
Very well. Court is adjourned!

December 28, 10:00 AM
District Court
Courtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.

Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.

Karma:
... The prosecution... is ready.

Judge:
... U-uh... right, very well. We have reached the final day of our proceedings in this trial. I ask that the prosecution submit decisive evidence.

Karma:
Understood.

Judge:
...

Phoenix:
(C'mon! Don't be awed into silence by every little thing he says!)

Judge:
Very well, Mr. von Karma, your opening statement.

Karma:
Right. Thanks to Detective Gumshoe's efforts, the boat rental shop caretaker has been arrested. In yesterday's trial, the defense asserted that the caretaker was the murderer. However, the caretaker has yet to confirm this. I would like to ask the defense to cross-examine him as much as necessary.

Judge:
Very well! Please bring the witness into the courtroom.

Karma:
Ladies and gentlemen of the court... I believe you all remember our witness. He lives in the boat rental shop on the lake, from where he witnessed the incident. In addition, he has currently lost memory of his name and identity.

Judge:
Witness! Why did you run away yesterday?

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
The witness was not running away, as he will now testify.

Judge:
I-I see. Very well, please begin your testimony.

Uncle:
Zzz... mmph?

Witness Testimony
-- Why I Left Court --
Uncle:
Er, I'm really sorry about just leaving yesterday like I did.
But, I wasn't running away or nothing.
I, uh, went to buy some food for Polly, see...
I figured I got nothing to do with this incident anyhow.
Er... I mean, I'd need one of those "motive" things, right? And I don't got one.
So, my testimony yesterday stands as is.

Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination, shall we?

Phoenix:
(He has to know his name! Yanni Yogi! You're Yanni Yogi and I'm going to prove it!)

Judge:
Might I say something, Mr. Wright?

Phoenix:
Yes... Yes, Your Honor?

Judge:
You've been saying the same thing now over and over. You've been calling the witness's memory of the past or lack thereof into question. But, does this really have anything to do with the current case?

Phoenix:
Of course, Your Honor. The witness has said he has "nothing to do with this case" and "no motive"... Both of these statements are lies!

Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Wright! There is a serious problem with your claim! Or... are you saying... Are you saying you know who this witness is!?

Phoenix:
Of course, Your Honor!

Karma:
Ho hoh! Now, this is interesting. I would like to know myself! So, who is he?

Phoenix:
(Don't play dumb von Karma!)

Judge:
Mr. Wright, please tell us this witness's name.

Phoenix:
His name is Yanni Yogi, a former court bailiff!

Judge:
... Yogi...? That name seems familiar. ... Oh! Yanni Yogi! From the DL-6 Incident!

Phoenix:
(I thought the judge would have heard of it... it was such a famous case.)

Judge:
But, what does this mean?

Phoenix:
Your Honor! If this man is Mr. Yogi, then he has a clear motive!

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Jumping to conclusions again, Mr. Wright! This man, this witness, is Yanni Yogi? Fascinating! However... How do you propose to prove this to the court?

Phoenix:
...

Karma:
This is a court of law, as you may recall. You need proof! And, allow me to repeat, once more, that the witness has lost his memory!

Phoenix:
(This is it... I have to do this now! If I can't prove he's Yogi right here, right now... Then I've got nowhere else to go!)

Maya:
Nick! How are you going to prove it!? How can you prove that he's Yanni Yogi?

Phoenix:
It's okay. It's actually quite simple. Your Honor! Please take this man's fingerprints! Then, we'll compare them to the fingerprints on file for Yanni Yogi 15 years ago...

Judge:
I see... that makes sense.

Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk!

Phoenix:
Huh?

Karma:
I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright.

Phoenix:
Wh-why?

Karma:
The witness... has no fingerprints!

Phoenix:
What? What!? No fingerprints!?

Uncle:
Er... you see, before I worked as a caretaker, I worked at a chemical plant. I burned my fingers working with the stuff. Ayup.

Phoenix:
Wh-what!? (Yogi, you sneak! You burned your fingerprints off to hide your past!)

Judge:
Hmm... Well, if the witness has no fingerprints... I guess we will not be able to prove his identity.

Phoenix:
(No...!)

Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Well, what will you do, Mr. Wright?

Phoenix:
Uh...

Karma:
Hmm? It seems that the case has been decided, no?

Phoenix:
(No!!! I know what happened! I know everything! I... I just can't prove it! But no... I can't let it end like this. I can't lose! There has to be another way!)

Karma:
There is no one who can testify as to who this witness is! No one!

Maya:
Nick! What are we going to do!?

Phoenix:
I didn't even consider that he might have erased his fingerprints... (What do I do!?)

Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Well, Mr. Wright? Perhaps you'd like to cross-examine the parrot for a little comic relief, hmm?

Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah, very funny. You're a sore winner, von Karma. ... Wait a second... "Cross-examine the parrot"?)

Maya:
Wh-what is it, Nick? No... you're not going to...!?

Phoenix:
Your Honor! The defense would like to take Mr. von Karma up on his proposal!

Judge:
Take Mr. von Karma up?

Karma:
On his... proposal?

Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor! I would like to cross-examine the witness's pet parrot!

Judge:
O-order! Order! Uh... well, what do you think, Mr. von Karma?

Karma:
Need you even ask!? This is a farce! I object!

Phoenix:
OBJECTION!

Phoenix:
Wait a second! You were the one who suggested I cross-examine the parrot, von Karma! I have a right to do as you suggested!

Karma:
Mmph... ... Well, if you're so desperate, then please, be my guest.

Phoenix:
!

Karma:
Of course, should you go through with this... And nothing comes of it, then I hope you're ready for the consequences.

Maya:
Nick... this is crazy!

Karma:
Well? Still want to go through with your little game!?

Judge:
Bailiff! Bring in the parrot.

Judge:
That's... quite a bird. Please tell us your name?

Parrot:
"..."

Judge:
Name!

Parrot:
"..."

Judge:
The witness is ignoring me.

Phoenix:
(It must be hurt... to be ignored by a bird.)

Judge:
Ahem. Very well, witness... Who is your owner? Please, er... testify for us.

Witness Testimony
-- Who Is Your Owner? --
Parrot:
"..."
"Hello! Hello!" *squawk*
"..."

Judge:
Hmm... Certainly the most concise testimony we've had so far. Very well, begin your cross-examination.

Phoenix:
Right...

Maya:
What are you going to do, Nick?

Phoenix:
... I... I don't know! What do we do, Maya?

Maya:
Hmm...

Maya:
W-well... I guess we should try to get some information out of her! We need to show the judge that her owner is Mr. Yogi!

Judge:
That's enough! I think we've reached a conclusion here.

Karma:
This is a mere coincidence, that's all!

Judge:
True, that is a possibility. However, two coincidences at the same time seems more like a "pattern" to me.

Karma:
Wh... what are you saying!?

Judge:
Summon the caretaker of the boat shop. Immediately!

Judge:
Witness... Tell us your name.

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
Wait! This witness, he doesn't remember...

Uncle:
No... it's okay.

Phoenix:
...!

Uncle:
I've accomplished what I wanted to do. I'm done.

Maya:
Nick! He looks totally different!

Phoenix:
This is the real Yogi, I think. Finally. He's been acting feeble to hide his true identity. Acting... for 15 years!

Judge:
W-well...! Let me ask you again. Please state your name for the court!

Yogi:
My name... is Yanni Yogi. 15 years ago, I served as a bailiff in this very court.

Judge:
Order! Order! Yanni Yogi! So was it you who killed Robert Hammond...? And tried to frame Miles Edgeworth for his death?

Yogi:
... Yes. It was me. I did it. ... They put me on the witness stand 15 years ago... Robert Hammond... he said I was mentally unsound. He told me it would make me innocent. Get me off the hook. So... I pretended to have brain damage... I was innocent, really! But he didn't believe me! We won the trial... But I lost everything. I lost my job, my fiancee, my social standing... ... Then, this year, 15 years later... A package arrived. It was a letter... and a pistol. The plan was written out in careful detail. It was a plan to take my revenge on the people who ruined my life. I didn't care who had sent it. I thought this was my chance, after 15 years, this was it! Finally, a chance to have my revenge on Robert Hammond and Miles Edgeworth... I have no regrets.

Judge:
W-wait a moment! Revenge... against Miles Edgeworth? What do you mean?

Yogi:
I'm not at liberty to speak on that matter. Why don't you ask Mr. Edgeworth yourself? Anyway, I admit it, I was the one who killed Robert Hammond.

Judge:
von Karma... Where is Mr. Yogi?

Karma:
Under arrest, Your Honor. I saw no room for error in his confession.

Judge:
Then... the defendant, Miles Edgeworth is...

Karma:
Innocent. In this case, at least.

Judge:
Hmm. Very well. Will the defendant please take the stand?

Judge:
There are a few mysteries left unsolved. Still, you are cleared of suspicion for this particular case. So I would like to pass judgment on the murder of Mr. Robert Hammond. Any objections?

Phoenix:
...

Edgeworth:
...

Karma:
...

Phoenix:
(I don't believe it! Why isn't von Karma saying anything?)

Judge:
Very well. This court finds the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...

Not Guilty
Judge:
That is all. The court is adjourned!

Edgeworth:
OBJECTION!

Judge:
D-did someone just say "objection"?

Phoenix:
(It wasn't von Karma...! Wait, but that means...) No... Edgeworth!?

Edgeworth:
Your Honor. I object to your judgment.

Judge:
Wh-what do you mean?

Edgeworth:
I'm not innocent at all! As we have heard, Yanni Yogi killed Robert Hammond in revenge. But, revenge for what?

Maya:
Nick! Edgeworth is trying to confess! He's going to say he's guilty! He's going to tell them he was the murderer in the DL-6 Incident! He's going to tell them he killed his own dad!

Phoenix:
(Uh oh! What do I do?)

Edgeworth:
For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream. A nightmare... it's only a nightmare. That's what I told myself. But now I know, it wasn't a dream. Yanni Yogi wasn't the killer.

Judge:
You mean... in the incident where your father died?

Edgeworth:
From the distance of the shot, it wasn't suicide, either. Everything was as clear as day. The murderer... The criminal in the DL-6 Incident... It was me! Your Honor! I confess my guilt! I am guilty for DL-6, the statute of limitations of which ends today! The culprit... is me!

Judge:
Order! Order! This is certainly unexpected! The defendant, declared innocent, is confessing to another crime! A crime for which the statute of limitations runs out today! I'm not really sure how I should deal with this...

Karma:
Bah! It's obvious. We hold a trial. Right here. Right now. We try this man for his crime of fifteen years ago!

Judge:
I think... I think I would like to take a five minute recess. During this time, I will consider the appropriate course of action to take. Court is adjourned!

December 28, 2:24 PM
District Court
Defendant Lobby No. 2
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, Wright. I've just wasted all of your effort.

Gumshoe:
... Mr. Edgeworth... I just don't believe it, pal! I mean, you... kill your dad?

Edgeworth:
I didn't want to believe it myself, Detective! But... it's the truth. I deserve to be punished. Murder is murder, no matter what the circumstances.

Gumshoe:
This is crazy! Just crazy!

Maya:
... ...? Nick? What are you doing?

Phoenix:
Huh? Oh... I was just reading through the Court Record once more. I'm getting my case ready.

Maya:
Your case... for what?

Phoenix:
Huh? Isn't it obvious? I'm going to prove that Miles Edgeworth is innocent.

Gumshoe:
...! Wh-what are you talking about, pal! He just admitted to it! He confessed that he did it! In court!

Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Edgeworth. But I don't believe in your "nightmare."

Edgeworth:
Wh-what!?

Phoenix:
It's just a dream. It's not real. The truth is right here in this Court Record. In any case, tighten your belts. The real fight is just beginning. I'll prove you're innocent. Trust me.

Edgeworth:
W-Wright...

December 28, 2:30 PM
District Court
Courtroom No. 3
Judge:
Then, I would like to resume our trial.

Karma:
Judge! Miles Edgeworth has admitted his own guilt. He has confessed his crime. Let us begin by hearing his testimony. Then, though pointless, let the defense do their cross-examining. The statute of limitations on the DL-6 Incident runs out today. Though it's unconventional for me, I'd like to run this one by the book.

Judge:
I see. Does the defense have any objections?

Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. (von Karma... you knew this was going to happen from the very beginning, didn't you!)

Judge:
Very well. Will Miles Edgeworth take the stand?

Karma:
Will the witness state his name and profession.

Edgeworth:
Miles Edgeworth... I am a prosecuting attorney.

Karma:
Mr. Edgeworth. Fifteen years ago, you mistakenly killed your father, Gregory Edgeworth. Is this correct?

Edgeworth:
... It is correct.

Karma:
Then testify about this matter to the court.

Phoenix:
(When Edgeworth was telling me about his dream yesterday I noticed something... One detail didn't quite fit. That will be the key... but only if I can get it to work!)

Maya:
Please... Please...

Witness Testimony
-- The DL-6 Incident --
Edgeworth:
That day, I had gone to the courtroom to observe one of my father's trials.
As we went to leave, an earthquake struck, trapping us in the elevator.
My father and Mr. Yogi lost their composure, and began to argue.
Just then, something heavy fell at my feet.
I picked it up, and threw it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted them to stop fighting.
A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream.
It was a terrible scream. I remember it to this day.
That's all.

Judge:
Hmm... And, until now, you thought this memory was a "dream"?

Edgeworth:
We were stuck in that elevator for five hours. The oxygen in the elevator ran out, and I lost my memory of the events.

Karma:
Bah! The same claim Mr. Yogi has made!

Judge:
Very well. Mr. Wright? Your cross-examination, please.

Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.

Judge:
O-order! Order! Mr. Wright! What are you driving at?

Phoenix:
It's simple, Your Honor. At the time of the incident, two shots were fired. One went into Gregory Edgeworth's heart. The other hit the elevator door. Remember that the defendant lost consciousness after the shot he fired rang out. In conclusion... We must agree that the second shot was fired by someone else!

Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! But who could that someone else be!?

Phoenix:
The murderer, of course!

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
... I knew I should have stepped in before your wild fantasies got out of hand. Mr. Wright... Look once more at the DL-6 Incident case file. Look closely. Try the "Case Summary" page.

Phoenix:
(The "Case Summary"... that's on page 1.)

Karma:
Look what is written there! "Not a single clue was found on the scene."

Phoenix:
...!

Karma:
If the pistol had indeed been fired two times... Then the other bullet would have been discovered on the scene!

Judge:
He does have a point.

Karma:
That second bullet has never been found! Why? Because the second bullet does not exist! The bullet that claimed Gregory Edgeworth's life was the one fired by his own son! That is the truth of this matter. The whole truth. It was undoubtedly something else that made that bullet hole in the door.

Judge:
Order! I will have order! ... Mr. Wright has proven one thing to us quite clearly... That the murder weapon was fired twice at the time of the incident. However! As Mr. von Karma says, the second bullet was not found. It is highly unlikely that the police merely overlooked this second bullet. So, all we have is the single bullet fired. I'm afraid I have to discount the defense's claim.

Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... I praise the judge for his wisdom in his matter.

Phoenix:
(Gah! How did this happen!? I don't believe that the second bullet didn't exist! Was I wrong? Have I been wrong about this whole incident?)

Maya:
What are you doing, Nick!? Why aren't you raising an objection!?

Phoenix:
... I'm sorry, Maya.

Maya:
What?

Phoenix:
I... It looks like I was wrong.

Maya:
Nick...?

Phoenix:
If the second bullet wasn't there, then all my conjectures are for nothing!

Maya:
N-no... But you said you'd do it, Nick! You said you'd get Edgeworth declared innocent!

Phoenix:
... I'm sorry... It's just, when I saw the photograph, I thought that two shots had been fired. I was so certain of it. I thought I'd won! I thought there was another person, someone else who fired the killing shot. But now... I was wrong to think it could be that simple. This case has stood unsolved for fifteen years!

Maya:
Nick...

Judge:
Well, it seems that we have finally cleared up this incident. Only one bullet was found at the scene of the crime. That shot was fired by Miles Edgeworth.

Karma:
Precisely.

Judge:
I would like to ask one thing of Miles Edgeworth before passing my verdict. Have you been paying attention to the trial so far?

Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor.

Judge:
Do you have any objections?

Edgeworth:
No... No, I do not.

Judge:
So you killed your father, though that was not your intention?

Edgeworth:
... Yes, I did.

Maya:
... Oh no... He's confessing... ...

Judge:
Very well. The statute of limitations on the murder of Gregory Edgeworth runs out today. Therefore, I must pronounce a verdict on the defendant, right here...

Karma:
Right now!

Judge:
Indeed. Does anyone have any objections?

Phoenix:
(I've been here before... It's just like my first day in court... There are so many things I know I should be saying... But my mind's gone blank, I can't find the words...)

Judge:
Mr. Wright?

Phoenix:
Your Honor! I... I object!

Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk. Mr. Wright, on what grounds do you object, hmm?

Phoenix:
Oof!

Maya:
Nick...?

Phoenix:
(I... I don't know! His case is perfect!)

Maya:
Oh no...

Phoenix:
Grah!

...it must exist...
...the second bullet...
Phoenix:
!!!
Phoenix:
Wh-what? What did you just say?

Maya:
N-nothing!

Phoenix:
(The second bullet must exist? But where!?)

...Someone took it...
Judge:
... It seems waiting is not going to produce us any answers from Mr. Wright.

Phoenix:
Wait, Your Honor!

Judge:
Hmm?

Phoenix:
I, uh... Th-the second bullet! It, uh, it exists!

Judge:
What!? But we've just heard proof that it did not exist!

Phoenix:
I-I realize that, Your Honor. (I'm really grasping here!) I-it's just, someone took it from the scene of the crime! That's what happened!

Judge:
But... Who!?

Phoenix:
Th-th-the murderer!

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
The murderer? Then tell us, just who is this "murderer"?

Phoenix:
I'm... still thinking about that one.

Judge:
Hmm... So the criminal took the second bullet? Why would he?

Phoenix:
Huh?

Judge:
First of all, how would he have found it? It's not easy to find a stray bullet, Mr. Wright! Was there some pressing need for the murderer to search for that bullet?

Phoenix:
(Why would the murderer have spent the time to look for that stray bullet...? I haven't got a clue!)

Judge:
What's wrong, Mr. Wright?

Phoenix:
Uh... Um...

Karma:
Bah! The murderer had no reason to take that bullet! You don't want to admit it, but it's true!

Phoenix:
Urk...

...had to take it...
Phoenix:
(Had to take it...? The murderer? What does that mean?)

...you're thinking too normal... think crazy...
...don't think why the bullet was taken...
...think why the bullet HAD to be taken...
Judge:
Mr. Wright?

Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor! (I have no idea what I'm doing...) U-uh, well, the murderer had no intention of taking the bullet from the scene. But... uh, the murderer HAD to take that bullet.

Judge:
"Had to," Mr. Wright? What do you mean?

Phoenix:
Well, for instance... (For instance WHAT!?) Uh, maybe the bullet, uh... hit the murderer?

Judge:
The bullet... hit the murderer?

Phoenix:
J-just saying, for instance. I mean, if it hit you, you would have to take it with you, wouldn't you? It's not like you could perform surgery right there. Y-y'know?

Judge:
...

Karma:
...

...

Phoenix:
(Wait a second... I was just talking off the top of my head, but what if that's really what happened?)

Judge:
Let me get this straight. So at the time of the murder, the murderer himself was shot? And he left with the second bullet still inside!? Thus leaving only one bullet at the scene of the crime?

Phoenix:
Uh, yes... I guess that's how it would work, yes.

Judge:
But there's a problem with that! The other two people rescued from that elevator... Miles Edgeworth and Yanni Yogi were both unharmed! So that would mean...

Phoenix:
The murderer came from outside, yes.

The two men fight inside the elevator. Trying to stop them, the boy picks up the pistol at his feet and throws it. The pistol discharges, and the bullet... The bullet goes through the elevator door and hits the murderer outside! The boy loses consciousness... Then the murderer opens the elevator door and sees the men inside...

Judge:
Hmm. Mr. Wright. You are truly the most unpredictable defense attorney I've ever known. I can tell you're grasping, yet I cannot deny the possibility of what you say.

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
What are you saying! Deny it! Deny it! No one involved with the incident was wounded! There was no "murderer"!

Judge:
Hmm...

Phoenix:
(No one was wounded at the time of the incident... He's right. I can't think of anyone...)

Maya:
Hey, Nick.

Phoenix:
Huh?

Maya:
I just thought of something really crazy.

Phoenix:
Crazy?

Maya:
Remember what Mr. Grossberg said yesterday?

Grossberg:
Gregory Edgeworth dealt a blow to his perfect trial record.

Maya:
Wow.

Grossberg:
It must have been quite a shock for von Karma. He took a vacation for several months after that, you see. Yes, an unusual event for the man. That was the first, and last vacation he's taken in his many years of prosecuting.

Maya:
What if von Karma didn't take that vacation because of shock...

Phoenix:
But took it because he was injured!

Maya:
Which would mean...

Phoenix:
It could only mean one thing!

Maya:
He was the murderer in the DL-6 Incident!

Phoenix:
He was the man who shot Gregory Edgeworth!

Maya:
It was... von Karma!

Phoenix:
(Oh man!)

Judge:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? You seem... dazed.

Phoenix:
Uh, n-no, Your Honor.

Judge:
Well? You have indicated the possibility that the murderer came from outside. Can you give us the name of your suspect?

Phoenix:
(Uh oh. Should I come out and say it now!?)

Phoenix:
Your Honor! There is a suspect... one lone suspect!

Karma:
...

Judge:
Well, this is certainly interesting news. Very well, Mr. Wright. Who is your suspect?

Phoenix:
V-V-V... (Urk! My h-hands are shaking!)

Judge:
V-what?

Phoenix:
von Karma!

Edgeworth:
von Karma!?

Karma:
...

Judge:
...

...

Judge:
You mean, THE von Karma? The prosecutor? Sitting right there?

Karma:
Bah.

Judge:
You... don't object?

Karma:
Hmph. I see no need. Why honor this ridiculous outburst with my objection?

Phoenix:
Because you took a vacation for several months starting the day after the incident! Yet you pride yourself on a perfect record! Why would you take such a long vacation without any reason!?

Karma:
So you're claiming that I took a vacation to heal my "injury" from the incident? Fascinating! Prove it. I would have needed surgery, no? Where did I go under the knife at, Mr. Wright!? Bring the doctor that operated on me! Have him testify!

Phoenix:
Urk...

Maya:
Nick! Let's find out who his doctor is!

Edgeworth:
It's no use.

Phoenix:
E-Edgeworth!?

Edgeworth:
I know von Karma. Perhaps too well. He's perfect. He wouldn't leave clues. He probably didn't undergo surgery. That would leave a doctor as a witness.

Phoenix:
(Grr... Nobody's that perfect!)

Maya:
So... so what, Nick? Did von Karma pull the bullet out by himself!? That's insane!

Phoenix:
No... he couldn't have. You can't just pull bullets out of yourself! ... (Wait... What does that mean...? That bullet has to be somewhere! But... where?)

Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Well, Mr. Wright! Can you produce evidence to prove that I was shot?

Phoenix:
Alright, von Karma. I'll prove it. And I'll even use evidence... I know how you like it so much.

Karma:
Wh-what!?

Phoenix:
The evidence that proves von Karma was shot is...!

Phoenix:
von Karma is perfect... He wouldn't risk surgery, leaving an evidence trail. So then, I ask, where is that bullet now? I think it unlikely that von Karma performed surgery on himself!

Judge:
...! You... you don't mean!

Phoenix:
I do. There is the possibility that the bullet is still inside von Karma!

Judge:
I-is that even possible? For all these years!?

Phoenix:
Well, there's one way to find out. We could use this metal detector! Well, von Karma? I'm going to run this over you, and see what we find.

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
... I... refuse!

Judge:
Y-you refuse...!? But, refusing this means... You acknowledge that the bullet is still inside you? Order! Order! Order!

Phoenix:
Your Honor! The defense requests that we be allowed to use the metal detector!

Karma:
OBJECTION!

Karma:
Judge! I call for a suspension of this trial! This is an invasion of privacy!

Phoenix:
OBJECTION!

Phoenix:
The statute of limitations runs out on this case today! It was you who said we had to end it right here, right now!

Karma:
Mm... mmmph!

Judge:
Enough! I permit the use of the metal detector. Mr. von Karma, you will submit yourself for testing!

Maya:
Nick! What does this mean...?

Phoenix:
I don't know... but we have to give it a shot!

...
*beep* *beep* *beeeeeep*
Phoenix:
(It reacted! Something's inside his right shoulder! The bullet!)

Phoenix:
... Mr. von Karma...?

Edgeworth:
... You! It was you!

Karma:
... I was afraid this would happen. And so, I remained silent.

Phoenix:
...?

Karma:
Indeed, there is a bullet in my shoulder. However... it has nothing to do with this incident!

Phoenix:
What!?

Karma:
I was shot in the shoulder long before the DL-6 Incident! I claim that the bullet in my shoulder has no relation to DL-6!

Judge:
B-but, Mr. von Karma! Can you prove that?

Karma:
"Prove"? I have no obligation to prove anything! It is you who must prove something here, Mr. Wright! Not I.

Judge:
M-Mr. Wright? Well? Can you prove it? Can you prove that the bullet in von Karma's shoulder was from DL-6?

Karma:
Of course he can't! You don't have any of the DL-6 evidence!

Phoenix:
(That's because you took it out of the Records Room yesterday!)

Karma:
With no proof, you cannot convict me of any crime! So sorry, Mr. Wright.

Phoenix:
No... I'm the one who's sorry, Mr. von Karma.

Karma:
Wh-what!?

Phoenix:
You were close... one day away from freedom. You see... I have proof!

Karma:
Wh-what!?

Phoenix:
Who would have thought you would have dug your own grave trying to convict Edgeworth! I can link that bullet in your shoulder to the DL-6 Incident... And here's my final proof!

Judge:
Th-that's... A bullet?

Karma:
Where did you get that!?

Phoenix:
This is the bullet used in the DL-6 Incident. This was taken from the heart of the victim, Mr. Gregory Edgeworth. The bullet is preserved quite nicely, with all the ballistic markings intact.

Edgeworth:
Ballistic markings...

Phoenix:
You may recall the term. It came up in the first trial, two days ago.

Judge:
Ballistic markings are the fingerprints of a weapon. All bullets fired from a gun are marked with that weapon's unique pattern. By examining the markings, you can tell which weapon fired the bullet. It's quite accurate.

Phoenix:
We have two bullets in our possession. One, the bullet removed from Gregory Edgeworth's heart. The other, Mr. von Karma, is the bullet buried in your shoulder. We could analyze both bullets... Then, if the markings matched... We would know that both bullets had been fired from the same gun! The very same pistol... in other words, the murder weapon that killed Gregory Edgeworth!

Karma:
Mmmph... mmmph!

Phoenix:
Mr. von Karma? You will let us remove the bullet from your shoulder. Then we'll compare the ballistic markings to those on this bullet... And solve this case once and for all! Well, Mr. von Karma!?

Karma:
Mmmrrrrrrgggh! Uuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

Uaaaaarrrr... aaa...oooh. Worrrrrrrggg... aaa...oooooh...

Edgeworth:
That scream... I've heard that scream before... Wait... I know!

"H-help! I can't breathe!"

"Quiet! I said quiet! You're not making this any easier!"

"Stop breathing my air! I'll... I'll stop you! Stop breathing my aaaaair!"

(Get away...! Get away from my father!)

*BANG*
Uuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

Edgeworth:
It's that scream I heard in the elevator! Fifteen years ago... von Karma! It was you who screamed!

Judge:
Mr. von Karma?

Karma:
Wooorrrrrrroooorrgggh Eh...Edgewoooooorrth......... ...Ehh...Edgewoooooorrth...... Only...you would... dare...defy me...!

Edgeworth:
So... it was you!

Karma:
You and your father are my curse! Your father shamed me with a penalty on my record! And you... you left a scar on my shoulder that would never fade! I... I'll bury you! I'll bury you with my bare hands! Death! Death!

Fifteen years earlier...
Karma:
Mr. Chief Prosecutor... I am sorry.

von Karma! It's not like you to make this kind of error... I never would have thought that Edgeworth would be the one to catch you.

Karma:
I... was careless.

I'm sorry, but you will have to be penalized. I've covered for you in the past, but not this time.

Karma:
...! Edgeworth!!!

It was a shock like none I had ever known. Me? Penalized!? It took hours for me to regain my composure. Suddenly, I found myself in the darkness... I was in the court records room. I must have wandered in there without thinking where I was going. The room was pitch black. The lights must have gone out. I went out in the hall and felt my way to the elevator. I pressed the button, and nothing happened. Then... there was a noise! I was in pain! A horrible, burning pain in my shoulder! Just then, the lights came back on. The elevator door opened before my eyes. I saw three people inside, all lying unconscious from oxygen deprivation. Much to my surprise, a pistol lay at my feet. I knew then... it was destiny. In his last moments, Gregory Edgeworth was still unconscious. He died, never knowing who had shot him. Later, he spoke through a medium, blaming Mr. Yogi. He was fooled! It was the perfect crime!

Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Who would have thought another man would have come to open that elevator door? Judge!

Judge:
Wh-what?

Karma:
What are you doing!? Do your job! Bring an end to this miserable charade! Now! End it!

Judge:
V-very well.

Judge:
It appears that we have come a very long way to the end of this maze. Fifteen years later... Mr. Miles Edgeworth?

Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor.

Judge:
You were innocent. You are innocent.

Edgeworth:
...

Judge:
As you said, it was all a "nightmare."

Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor.

Judge:
This court finds the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...

Not Guilty
Judge:
That is all. The court is adjourned!
